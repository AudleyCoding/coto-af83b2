# Shopping List Aggregator - Features & Offline Setup

## How to Get the App Running Offline

### The Problem
By default, if you access the app through a local server (like `python3 -m http.server`), it requires your MacBook to be running and connected to the same WiFi network. This is not practical for daily restaurant use at the market.

### The Solution: Progressive Web App (PWA) via "Add to Home Screen"

The app is designed as a Progressive Web App that can work completely offline once properly installed on your iPhone/iPad. Here's how:

#### Step-by-Step Offline Setup

**1. Choose a Hosting Method**

You need to host the file in a location accessible to your iPhone. Pick ONE of these options:

- **Option A: iCloud Drive (Recommended)**
  1. On your Mac, copy `shopping-list.html` to iCloud Drive
  2. On your iPhone, open Files app → iCloud Drive
  3. Tap on `shopping-list.html`
  4. It will open in Safari

- **Option B: Dropbox/Google Drive**
  1. Upload `shopping-list.html` to your cloud storage
  2. Get a public sharing link
  3. Open the link in Safari on your iPhone
  4. Wait for page to fully load

- **Option C: Email to Yourself**
  1. Email `shopping-list.html` as an attachment to yourself
  2. On iPhone, open the email in Mail app
  3. Tap the attachment
  4. Choose "Open in Safari"

- **Option D: Local Network (One-time setup only)**
  1. On Mac: `python3 -m http.server 8000` (in the project folder)
  2. Find Mac's IP: System Settings → Network (e.g., 192.168.1.100)
  3. On iPhone (same WiFi): Safari → `http://192.168.1.100:8000/shopping-list.html`
  4. Proceed immediately to Step 2 below before closing the server

**2. Add to Home Screen (CRITICAL STEP)**

This is what makes it work offline:

1. With the app open in Safari on your iPhone/iPad
2. Tap the **Share** button (square with arrow pointing up) at the bottom
3. Scroll down and tap **"Add to Home Screen"**
4. Name it (e.g., "Shopping List" or "Coto Shopping")
5. Tap **"Add"**

**3. Verify Offline Functionality**

1. Close Safari completely
2. Turn off WiFi or disconnect from your Mac
3. Tap the new app icon on your home screen
4. The app should open and work perfectly!

#### Why This Works

When you "Add to Home Screen":
- Safari caches the entire HTML file on your device
- React and Tailwind CSS libraries are cached from their CDNs
- All your data is stored in localStorage (never leaves your device)
- The app becomes a standalone web app (no Safari UI)
- Works exactly like a native iOS app
- Survives phone restarts, iOS updates, etc.

#### Important Notes

- **First load requires internet**: To download React/Tailwind from CDNs
- **After that, 100% offline**: No internet or server needed
- **Data is local only**: Each device stores its own data
- **Use Export/Import**: To sync recipes between devices (iPad ↔ iPhone ↔ Mac)
- **Updates to the file**: If you modify `shopping-list.html`, you need to remove and re-add the home screen icon
